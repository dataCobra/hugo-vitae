## Features

### GDPR in mind

The GDPR has many rules for third party assets, so if you don't want to think
about GDPR complaints you can disable every third party asset that is
integrated.

Some websites using webfonts from third party sites like google. This theme
brings FontAwesome and Roboto(-Slab) directly with it, without having to
integrate them via third party sites.

### Multilingual support for month names and fixed strings

#### month names

Due to the currently unavailable feature for multilingual dates in `.Date`
from Go. It is possible to create a `month.yaml` in the data folder of your
Hugo site root directory. There is also an example file in
`exampleSite/data/`.

```sh
cat > month.yaml << EOF
1: "Jan"
2: "Feb"
3: "Mar"
4: "Apr"
5: "May"
6: "Jun"
7: "Jul"
8: "Aug"
9: "Sep"
10: "Oct"
11: "Nov"
12: "Dec"
EOF
```

#### fixed strings

There are some fixed strings in the html files that normally uses only the set
language. But if you create a folder `i18n/` in the root directory of your
hugo site and copy the `en.yaml` that comes with the theme you can edit the
fixed strings to your liking. Don't forget to also set
`defaultContentLanguage = "en"` to the new language.

```sh
mkdir i18n
cd i18n
cp ../themes/hugo-vitae/i18n/en.yaml en.yaml
# Edit the new language file
```

### FontAwesome for social icons

FontAwesome is mainly used for the icons of the social navbar in the top right
corner of the theme. In the config of your Hugo website there is a param
called `icon` for the `params.social` section. I could look like this:

```toml
[[params.social]]
name = "Github"
icon = "fab fa-github"
url = "https://github.com/dataCobra/hugo-vitae"
```

On the [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com) website, you can look up every
free icon and also the information you need to put into this `icon` param.

### Site configuration options

All configuration options can be looked up in the `exampleSite/config.toml`.

### Favicon

After enabling `favicon` support, create a new file inside your project `layouts/partials` folder named `favicon.html`, and setup favicon as you need

```html
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="{{ relURL "favicon.ico" }}" />

<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="{{ relURL "apple-touch-icon.png" }}" />
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="{{ relURL "favicon-32x32.png" }}" />
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="16x16" href="{{ relURL "favicon-16x16.png" }}" />

<link rel="mask-icon" color="#00E" href="{{ relURL "safari-pinned-tab.svg" }}" />

<meta name="msapplication-TileColor" content="#00E" />
```

You can generate your favicons using [realfavicongenerator.net](https://realfavicongenerator.net).
